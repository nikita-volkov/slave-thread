-- Vanilla thread management in Haskell is low level and
-- it does not approach the problems related to thread deaths.
-- When it's used naively the following typical problems arise:
--
-- * When a forked thread dies due to an uncaught exception,
-- the exception does not get raised in the main thread,
-- which is why the program continues to run as if nothing happened,
-- i.e., with the presumption that the already dead thread is running normally.
-- Naturally this may very well bring your program to a chaotic state.
--
-- * Another issue is that one thread dying does not
-- affect any of the threads forked from it.
-- That's why your program may be accumulating ghost threads.
--
-- * Ever dealt with your program ignoring the \<Ctrl-C\> strikes?
--
-- This library solves all the issues above with a concept of a slave thread.
-- A slave thread has the following properties:
--
-- 1. When it dies for whatever reason (exception or finishing normally)
-- it kills all the slave threads that were forked from it.
-- This protects you from ghost threads.
--
-- 2. It waits for all slaves to die and execute their finalizers
-- before executing its own finalizer and getting released itself.
-- This gives you hierarchical releasing of resources.
--
-- 3. When a slave thread dies with an uncaught exception
-- it reraises it in the master thread.
-- This protects you from silent exceptions
-- and lets you be sure of getting informed
-- if your program gets brought to an erroneous state.

-- | A slave thread crashed. This exception is classified as /asynchronous/,
-- meaning it extends from 'SomeAsyncException'.
--
-- In general,
--
-- * /Synchronous/ exceptions such as 'IOException' are thrown by IO actions
--   that are explicitly called by the thread that receives them, and may be
--   caught, inspected, and handled by resuming execution.
-- * /Asynchronous/ exceptions such as 'ThreadKilled' should normally only be
--   caught temporarily in order to run finalizers, then re-thrown.
--
-- 'SlaveThreadCrashed' being asynchronous means it should, by default, cause
-- the entire thread hierarchy to come crashing down, ultimately terminating the
-- program.
--
-- If you want more sophisticated behavior, such as a "supervisor" thread that
-- monitors and restarts worker threads when they fail, you have to program
-- that yourself.
--
-- N.B. Consider using a library like
-- @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/safe-exceptions safe-exceptions>@ or
-- @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unliftio unliftio>@, which carefully
-- distinguish synchronous and asynchronous exceptions, unlike @base@.

-- $note-unmask
--
-- == Masking
--
-- Threads forked by this library, unlike in @base@, /already/ mask asynchronous
-- exceptions internally, for bookkeeping purposes.
--
-- The @*withUnmask@ variants of 'fork' are thus different from the
-- @*withUnmask@ variants found in @base@ and @async@, in that the unmasking
-- function they provide restores the masking state /to that of the calling context/,
-- as opposed to /unmasked/.
--
-- Put another way, the @base@ code that you may have written as:
--
-- @
-- mask (\\unmask -> forkIO (initialize >> unmask computation))
-- @
--
-- using this library would be instead written as:
--
-- @
-- 'forkWithUnmask' (\\unmask -> initialize >> unmask computation)
-- @
--
-- And the @base@ code that you may have written as:
--
-- @
-- mask_ (forkIOWithUnmask (\\unmask -> initialize >> unmask computation))
-- @
--
-- will instead have to /manually/ call the low-level unmasking function called
-- 'GHC.IO.unsafeUnmask', as:
--
-- @
-- mask_ ('forkWithUnmask' (\\_ -> initialize >> unsafeUnmask computation))
-- @
--
-- Note that we used 'forkWithUnmask' (to guarantee @initialize@ is run with
-- asynchronous exceptions masked), but the unmasking function it provided does
-- not guarantee asynchronous exceptions are actually unmasked, so we toss it
-- and use 'GHC.IO.unsafeUnmask' instead.
--
-- This idiom is uncommon, but necessary when you need to fork a thread in
-- library code that is unsure if it's being called with asynchronous exceptions
-- masked (as in the "acquire" phase of a @bracket@ call).
